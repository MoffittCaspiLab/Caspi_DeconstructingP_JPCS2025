## Paper Abstract: 
Most etiological research on mental disorders tries to find specific causes of specific disorders. But the search for causal specificity has been elusive. In fact, new evidence reveals that the major etiological factors are transdiagnostic. One possible reason for why the search for specificity has been elusive is that most disorders are more similar than they are distinct, an idea that prompted research on ‘p’ – the tendency of a person to develop a wide range of different mental disorders. Here we bring together data from unique sources to provide the intergenerational and developmental empirical evidence base for understanding ‘p’. Men and women with a history of mental disorders tend to mate with partners who are also prone to have mental disorders, but not necessarily the same disorders. This creates a situation whereby their offspring, whether through genetic and/or environmental transmission, are at heightened risk of developing a variety of different mental disorders, but which specific disorder offspring ultimately develop is not easy to predict. Given that offspring inherit these multiple liabilities, it may not surprise that these liabilities manifest as different disorders at different points throughout their lives, but which disorder emerges at a particular time is difficult to foretell. The intergenerational and developmental evidence about the familiality and course of mental disorders helps to deconstruct ‘p’ and invites psychopathology research and clinical science to reconsider their common approach to studying one mental disorder at a time.

### Data availability: 
The Danish data are hospital records for entire cohorts of the Danish population. The authors cannot share these data with other researchers. Researchers who wish to use the data may request permission through Statistics Denmark. The Norwegian data are primary-care records for entire cohorts of the Norwegian population. The authors cannot share these data with other researchers. Researchers can access the data by application to the Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics and the data owners (Statistics Norway and the Norwegian Directorate of Health). The Dunedin Longitudinal Study data are available on request by qualified scientists. Requests require a concept paper describing the purpose of data access, ethical approval at the applicant’s institution, and provision for secure data access.
